  links), where each node can additionally point to arbitrary data in
  memory.

  This is an abstraction used to build more specific structures.

  Return the pointer of the link to the node that is a given depth from
  the starting node down a specific link index, this can then be
  dereferenced to point to the specific node link for, for example, its
  definition:
  
  @code{.c}

  dgNode* leafNode = dgCreate(NULL, 2);

  Presuming the link is defined, if dereferenced again, you can then set
  the linked node's attributes (i.e., payload and links). Alternatively,
  the dgTraverse() helper function makes this more straightforward.
