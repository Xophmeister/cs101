/**
@page style Style Guide

I note that C programmers idiomatically use `snake_case` for their
symbols and `BLOCK_CAPS` for macros and constants. I prefer `camelCase`
for everything and tend to shy away from capitals, unless it aids
readability. Perhaps I'm allergic to underscores!? Tabbing and bracing
style are holy wars, so let's not get into that. I don't care for
Hungarian notation, but use something similar to pseudo-namespace my
functions.
